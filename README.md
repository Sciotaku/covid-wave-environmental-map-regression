# Module Overview

## Module
<a href="https://envs3-app-yaex.onrender.com/">Click here to access the app.</a> The application is hosted on Render.

## Module Objective 
Give students exposure to data science through the analysis and visualization of data, and interpreting and communicating results in the context of examining the impact of environmental factors on COVID-19 mortality.

## Student Learning Objectives
1.	Apply data visualization methods and interpret the results.
2.	Generate and test hypotheses about relationships between different variables and health outcomes.
3.	Build and use models to predict outcomes.

## Module Description
Students use demographics and environmental data coupled with COVID-19 mortality data from four waves of the epidemic to examine impacts on mortality.  The environmental data focuses on the so-called "Cancer Alley" in Louisiana where environmental contamination has pushed cancer rates much higher than average.  Students use visualizations to build hypotheses and then test their proposed relationship by examining correlations and results from linear regression.

### Data
The module uses statistical data from Louisiana parishes including demographics, population characteristics, toxic emissions, and respiratory hazard, couple with mortality data from four COVID waves.

### Platform
The module is hosted as an application on <a href="https://envs3-app-yaex.onrender.com/">render</a>.  The underlying code is in python.

## Course Information

This module was developed for a environmental science course, <a href="http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Environmental-Studies-Program/ENVS-Environmental-Studies/ENVS-3">Environment and Society</a>, at Dartmouth College which explores the interconnections and impacts between environmental and societal factors.  The course is introductory and draws students from different interests and backgrounds.
